# ML-Book-recommender

 The book recommendation system aims to provide personalized book suggestions using advanced collaborative filtering techniques. The key features of the system are:
-  Data Collection and Preprocessing:Collect data on books (including ratings, reviews, and details such as genres and authors).Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing, and structuring it for use in the recommendation model.
- Recommendation Engine: 
Collaborative Filtering: This technique relies on user-item interactions to recommend books. The system will use past user behavior and preferences to suggest relevant books.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is used to find books with the highest similarity to the user’s selected book, ensuring the recommendations are tailored.

- User Interface (UI):Streamlit will be used to develop a web-based interface where users can:Select a book from a list or enter their favorite book.View recommendations that include book names and cover images (posters).The interface will display the recommendations in an organized manner, making the system user-friendly and visually engaging.
