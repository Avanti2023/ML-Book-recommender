# ML-Book-recommender

 The book recommendation system aims to provide personalized book suggestions using advanced collaborative filtering techniques. The key features of the system are:
-  **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:  Collect data on books (including ratings, reviews, and details such as genres and authors).Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing, and structuring it for use in the recommendation model.
- **Recommendation Engine**: 
Collaborative Filtering→This technique relies on user-item interactions to recommend books. The system will use past user behavior and preferences to suggest relevant books.  
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)→KNN is used to find books with the highest similarity to the user’s selected book, ensuring the recommendations are tailored.

- **User Interface (UI)**: Streamlit will be used to develop a web-based interface where users can:  
→ Select a book from a dropdown list or enter the name of their favorite book manually  
→ View personalized book recommendations, including:  
  → 📚 *Book names*  
  → 🖼️ *Cover images (posters) pulled dynamically*  
→ Interact with a user-friendly and visually engaging layout, designed to display recommendations in a structured and attractive format
